# Puerro Project

The goal of this project is to research how to build modern web applications as simple as possible.


## Idea

To not loose our train of thought, we need to have a structured method on how to handle the research process. 

The idea is to build a showcase project by simulating interactions between a developer and a customer.

- **Customer**: wants an easy to use and modern web application
- **Developer**: wants to develop the application as simple as possible

Therefore, the developer needs to research and evaluate different approaches to build the application 
as simple as possible while still meeting customer demands.

The showcase application should contain as many UI-Patterns as possible.
