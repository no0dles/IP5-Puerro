## Development Process

### State management

We now have a central state which needs to be represented in different ways.
There are two main approaches with which this can be done. 

**Component based**
In a component based system, the central state is injected into each component and is mutated either through direct mutations on the state or actions which mediate the mutations.... tbc

**MVC**
MVC is a pattern which focuses very much on separation of concerns. All actions are made through the controller, this way the interface of what is possible is clearly defined. This is especially useful with large scale applications...... tbc
