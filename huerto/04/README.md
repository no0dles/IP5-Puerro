> > **Developer**: What do you think about the validation?

> > **Customer**: It's very nice! I make way less mistakes now. But since you are asking. I still from time to time make spelling errors. It would be quite handy if I could correct these once I've entered them.

> > **Developer**: Good point. What about other fields, like the quantity or origin?
>
> > **Customer**: I haven't thought about that! Yes of course! The best case would be that I can change all the fields. I just recently forgot to water my tomatoes because I haven't written it as a comment. I don't know if they will survive.. I might need to remove it soon. Could you add a delete functionality as well? As sad as it sounds.

> > **Developer**: Of course, this will complete the whole CRUD spectrum.

> > **Customer**: Yeah ok, you lost me.. but It sure sounds professional.
