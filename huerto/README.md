# Huerto
## About
This is a showcase project, showing how an interaction between a developer and a customer could go. It shows the internal decision making on the side of the developer and explores the different approaches one could take for such a project.

The Project itself is about a customer who want's to manage their vegetable garden and has new ideas for each iteration of the project. The goal of the customer as well as the developer is to keep the project as simple as possible.

## Iterations
### Iteration 01

During the first meeting with the customer asks the following of the developer: "I want to be able to add a vegetable to a list, I want the name of the vegetable to be any text I want"

After the interaction the developer creates a user story:
- As a user I want to add a vegetable to a list.

The developer thinks about the different ways he could approach this problem:
- Use a framework and tooling around it to create the web application.
- Start small and try to implement the first requirement with pure HTML and JavaScript.

He decides to go for the most lean way and simply start with a single input element with pure HTML and JavaScript, which lead to the following [result](https://github.com/robin-fhnw/IP5-Puerro/tree/master/huerto/Iteration%2001).
