# Huerto - Season 01

## Conversation

> > **Customer**: Yo, I've heard that your are studying something with computers. Can you create a quick homepage for me?
>
> > **Developer**: Hey! The web is awesome, but computer science is about much more than the web. Not every computer scientist creates content for the web. And it's called website - not homepage.
>
> > **Customer**: Yes! Website! See, you know what I'm talking about. I want to start my own vegetable garden and I think that I need some technological support. I've heard a lot about Big Data, Cloud and AI lately. That's why I want a website!
>
> > **Developer**: So you need a web application to manage your vegetable garden.. What should it be able to do?
>
> > **Customer**: Good question! I don't really know yet. I'm a little forgetful, so it would be nice if I can enter my vegetables. With this I could see what I have planted in my garden.
>
> > **Developer**: I am currently experimenting a bit with the creation of web applications anyway. I could probably use your idea for that. I'll create a simple solution and come back to you.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to add a vegetable to a list.

  _// **TODO:** Maybe this section is not needed?_

## Developer Thoughts

- Should I use a framework and tooling around it to create the web application.

- Should I start small and try to implement the first requirement with pure HTML and JavaScript.
- It should be testable right away.
  - Testframeworks?

## Result

We are going for the most simple way and start with a single input element with pure HTML and JavaScript.
