# Conclusion

The thesis for this project was, that big frameworks are not always needed for frontend Web Applications and that one can get very far by using a minimal amount of abstractions. 

The work done in the showcase project "[Huerto](../huerto)" shows that different problems call for different approaches. The more complex an application gets, the more helpful small thought out abstractions are. 

For large scale applications it is also very useful to hold to a specific architecture. In the Huerto example a variant of MVC is used. If used it is very important to hold to the principles given by the pattern used, to ensure consistency. Consistency is imperative in large scale web apps since it makes the codebase clean and maintainable.
