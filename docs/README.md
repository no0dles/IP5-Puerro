This is what's happening in the Puerro Project (newest first):

# Kick-Off (19.02.2019)
We started our IP5 project with the goal to research the most simple approaches to develop user interfaces for modern web applications.

## The Problem

Nowadays, most web UI's depend on front-end frameworks/libraries (like Angular, Vue or React). These technologies are powerful, but they also lock programmers in by making it difficult to have a presentation layer independent of the rendering technology.

Each technology has their own *way of working* which doesn't integrate with others.

This makes it, especially in the fast chaning web front-end world, a challenging problem. 

It takes a lot of time to learn a new framework/library and to build an application with it.

This could be a bad investiment, as the technology is very likely outdated soon and the application would need to be rebuild nearly from scratch.

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to explore new, unconventional, and unorthodox approaches to Web UI development with JavaScript and validate their usefulness against typical UI patterns.

Hopefully finding a way to become independent of today's frameworks.
