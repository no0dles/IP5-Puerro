# Introduction

Welcome to the Puerro Project

## Purpose

Nowadays, most web UI's depend on front-end frameworks/libraries (like Angular, Vue or React). These technologies are powerful, but they also lock programmers in by making it difficult to have a presentation layer independent of the rendering technology.

Each technology has their own _way of working_ which doesn't integrate with others.

This makes it, especially in the fast chaning web front-end world, a challenging problem.

It takes a lot of time to learn a new framework/library and to build an application with it.

This could be a bad investiment, as the technology is very likely outdated soon and the application would need to be rebuild nearly from scratch.

With this project, we want to acquire knowledge about how to build modern frontend web applications as simple as possible by researching different approaches.

## Methodology



## Scope

To make our examples and research work in real-life scenarios there would be a need for backend systems to store data and handle business logic. The scope of this project however is limited to client-side scripting. This restriction is put in place to ensure, the project does not scratch the surface of different parts of web development, but to dive deep into the specific world of frontend development. 

To explore how JavaScript and HTML work and interact with each other in depth, styling, specifically CSS is also considered out of scope.

Build tooling and browser compatibility is a big part in todays frontend world. Again to keep the focus and not get distracted by tooling, this project is respecting the following standards and the browsers which support those:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- ES6 (JavaScript version)
