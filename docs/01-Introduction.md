# Introduction

Welcome to the Puerro Project

## Purpose

Nowadays, most web UI's depend on front-end frameworks/libraries (like Angular, Vue or React). These technologies are powerful, but they also lock programmers in by making it difficult to have a presentation layer independent of the rendering technology.

Each technology has their own _way of working_ which doesn't integrate with others.

This makes it, especially in the fast chaning web front-end world, a challenging problem.

It takes a lot of time to learn a new framework/library and to build an application with it.

This could be a bad investiment, as the technology is very likely outdated soon and the application would need to be rebuild nearly from scratch.

With this project, we want to acquire knowledge about how to build modern frontend web applications as simple as possible by researching different approaches.
